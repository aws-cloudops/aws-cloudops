The Silver Lining program is delivered by a community of volunteers who donate their time to
develop content, deliver courses, mentor students, and organize schedules. We are pleased to be
able to deliver the program free of charge for students, especially those who are at a disadvantage
because of unforeseen hardships -- financial difficulties, having to care for a loved one, unexpectedly unemployed, etc. 
We think that anyone can launch a career in IT, given some concentrated effort. We also recognize that, in current times,
a college degree in computer science is simply out of reach for many people. 

Our aim is to provide the roadmap of topics that a smart, motivated candidate can use to learn the basics of 
cloud engineering and land a job in the industry.
