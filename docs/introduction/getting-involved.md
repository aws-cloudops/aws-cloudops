Interested to help with Silver Lining? Great! We have a place for you. 

There are a few ways to contribute: as an Instructor, as a Content Producer, or as an Industry Speaker.  

## Instructors
At the moment, Silver Lining Instructors are AWS Solutions Architects or customers of AWS. If you 
are on the inside, feel free to fire a Slack message at dixonaws or drewjeff. We deliver classes 
emotely via Chime from 6:30-8:30 Eastern Time, two nights per week. We run one cohort per year, from February to June.

### Why become an instructor?

## Content Producers
We welcome corrections and additions. Feel free to file a Pull Request at the various Github repos
associated with this project, and one of the core contributors will review it for accuracy. Our content is written in
Markdown and processed by a static site generator (Docusaurus or Hugo as of now). Feel free to Slack dixonaws for 
more information.

### Why develop content?
Sharpen your content development skills. Our content covers the fundamental skills of entering the IT industry as
a cloud support engineer - everything from Linux administration, servers, storage, networking, 3-tier applications,
monitoring and advanced topics like Generative AI. We produce content primarily with Markdown and host it as a
static Docusaurus site in AWS (S3 and Cloudfront, managed by Amplify).

## Industry Speakers
We're always looking for guest speakers from industry to hold a 60-minute session about the role of cloud in their
business. What is the role of a cloud support engineer at your company? Why is it important? What is the profile of
the ideal candidate? If you're interested in speaking in one of our cohorts, we'd love to hear from you!

### Benefits of becoming an industry speaker
Aside from giving back to the community and sharing your knowledge with those who could benefit, you can use
speaking opportunities to sharpen your skill in explaining complex technology to a diverse audience. Since our candidates
come from widely varying backgrounds, speakers may need to use more than one approach to explain their selected 
topic.

## Mentors
One of the most important roles in Silver Lining is mentoring students as they advnce through the program, giving
feedback and helping to identify areas where they can dive deep. Feel free to Slack dixonaws for more information.
