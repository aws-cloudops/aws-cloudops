In case you're here looking for ways to get involved in producing or delivering content, there are a few ways to 
do this. 

## Instructors
At the moment, all of the Silver Lining Instructors are AWS Solutions Architects or customers of AWS. If you are on the inside, feel free
to fire a Slack message at dixonaws or drewjeff. We deliver classes remotely via Chime from 6:30-8:30 Eastern Time, 
two nights per week. We run one cohort per year, from February to June.

## Content Producers
We welcome corrections and additions. Feel free to file a Pull Request at the various Github repos
associated with this project, and one of the core contributors will review it for accuracy. Our content is written in
Markdown and processed by a static site generator (Docusaurus or Hugo as of now). Feel free to Slack dixonaws for 
more information.
