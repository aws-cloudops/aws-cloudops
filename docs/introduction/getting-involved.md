Interested to help with Silver Lining? There are a few ways to do this: 

## Instructors
At the moment, all of the Silver Lining Instructors are AWS Solutions Architects or customers of AWS. If you are on the inside, feel free
to fire a Slack message at dixonaws or drewjeff. We deliver classes remotely via Chime from 6:30-8:30 Eastern Time, 
two nights per week. We run one cohort per year, from February to June.

## Content Producers
We welcome corrections and additions. Feel free to file a Pull Request at the various Github repos
associated with this project, and one of the core contributors will review it for accuracy. Our content is written in
Markdown and processed by a static site generator (Docusaurus or Hugo as of now). Feel free to Slack dixonaws for 
more information.

## Industry Speakers
We're always looking for guest speakers from industry to hold a 60-minute session about the role of cloud in their
business. What is the role of a cloud support engineer at your company? Why is it important? What is the profile of
the ideal candidate? If you're interested in speaking in one of our cohorts, we'd love to hear from you!

## Mentors
One of the most important roles in Silver Lining is mentoring students as they advnce through the program, giving
feedback and helping to identify areas where they can dive deep. Feel free to Slack dixonaws for more information.
