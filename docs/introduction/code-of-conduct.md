## Being Professional
The Silver Lining program is delivered by a community of volunteers who donate their time to 
develop content, deliver courses, mentor students, and organize schedules. We are pleased to be
able to deliver the program free of charge for students. We ask that students in the program respect instructors
and fellow students alike.

* Recognize that students are come from widely varying backgrounds and experience
* Take the opportunity to help someone else with the material - it will reinforce your understanding
* Be inclusive - avoid monopolizing limited class time
* Be respectful - wait your turn
* Use the Raise Hand function in Chime
* Correct the content when you find a mistake using the "Edit this Page" links
