# Philosophy
This is not a coding bootcamp. We realize that you can search the internet and skill up
on just about anything. But where to begin? What are the most important things to know? Which
careers have entry points accessible to you? Do I need a background in IT to start?

## Tenets
The authors have a few basic ideas in mind when developing the course:
* Learn by doing
* Provide an outline of what is most important to know to get a job in cloud operations
* Assume no prior knowledge in IT
* This course will never be exhaustive

## Who you Are
You'd like to enter the information technology field via cloud computing. You're motivated to dive deep - put in the time to 
learn new things, make connections, meet like-minded people, and have fun doing it. Maybe you come from a career path
outside of IT, or maybe you're just starting out. Maybe your current IT skillset needs a tune up.

## Who we Are
We are a group of volunteers at Amazon Web Services who think that great careers in IT can be accessible to
anyone who has the interest and motivation. You don't need a degree in Computer Science to have a great career
as a cloud operations engineer.


## What you'll need
At minimum, you'll need an internet connection and a PC or Mac. Many of the authors use macOS.

## Start anytime
Although we offer an instructor-led program once per year, you can use the self-guided resources
at your own pace to build the skills necessary to launch a career as a cloud operations engineer.
