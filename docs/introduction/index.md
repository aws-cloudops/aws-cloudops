Companies large and small are using cloud computing to optimize their businesses. As a result, there is an 
increasing need for engineers to maintain systems. The Silver Lining program was created to address this need 
by training entry-level cloud engineers and connecting them to hiring managers in the industry.

To skill up for an entry-level job as a cloud support engineer, you should focus on acquiring a 
combination of technical skills, practical experience, and soft skills. We created the Silver Lining program to 
address each of these:

## Technical Skills
### Learn AWS
Familiarize yourself with popular cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- understand 
the core services (such as EC2), how the platform is structured, and how services are priced. See our [Learning Roadmap](https://www.aws-cloudops.com/docs/getting_started/learning_roadmap).
* Fundamentals: Operating Systems, Storage, Networking: Understand basic networking concepts like IP addressing, routing, subnetting, and DNS.

## Practical Experience
### Hands-On Practice
Set up your own cloud environment (using free tiers if available) and practice deploying and managing 
various services. Work on projects that simulate real-world scenarios to gain practical experience.

### Troubleshooting Skills
Develop problem-solving and troubleshooting skills. Practice diagnosing and resolving 
common issues that may arise in a cloud environment.

in relevant online communities.

## Gain Experience and Build Your Portfolio
Your portfolio includes not only your resume, but also your GitHb repos, YouTube videos, speaking engagements, 
and blog posts. Consider internships, freelance projects, Meetup groups, or volunteer work to gain 
practical experience and build your portfolio.

### Networking
Attend industry events, meetups, and conferences to network with professionals already working in the field. Networking can help you learn from others' experiences and potentially uncover job opportunities.

Make learning a habit. Cloud computing is a dynamic field, and continuous learning is essential to stay 
relevant and advance your career.

By following these steps and staying dedicated to your learning journey, you'll be well-equipped to land an entry-level job as a cloud support engineer.
