# Course Outline
This is not a coding bootcamp. We realize that you can search the internet and skill up
on just about anything. But where to begin? What are the most important things to know? Which
careers have entry points accessible to you? Do I need a background in IT to start?

## Who you Are

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

## Who WE Are
We are a group of volunteers at Amazon Web Services who think that great careers in IT can be accessible to
anyone who has the interest and motivation. You don't need a degree in Computer Science to have a great career
as a cloud operations engineer.


## What you'll need
An internet connection

## Start anytime
Although we offer an instructor-led program once per year, you can use the self-guided resources
at your own pace to build the skills necessary to launch a career as a cloud operations engineer.
