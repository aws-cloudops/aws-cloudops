In this module, students return to learn advanced Linux server administration and some Identify and 
Access Management (IAM). 

While you're here, you should check out 
the [command-line text editors in Linux](https://docs.rackspace.com/support/how-to/command-line-text-editors-in-linux/) for
a couple of options to edit files on a Linux machine. Or try to [learn VIM for the last time](https://danielmiessler.com/study/vim/)! Being proficient with a tool like vim or nano or emacs in Linux
is time well spent.


Estimated time to complete the workshops for an expert: ~20 mins
Estimated time for a beginner: 1 hour
