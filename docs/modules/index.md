Ideally, you should follow the modules in order and complete all of the homework. The homework is designed to be
representative of a task you may face on the job as a cloud administrator, so you may need to practice until you

to be a practice explaining the technology, which is also a fundamental part of many cloud administrator roles (particularly as you advance).
