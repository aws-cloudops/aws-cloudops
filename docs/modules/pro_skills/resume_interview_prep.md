Consider your resume as one part of your portfolio as a technical professional. Your complete portfolio should include:
* Traditional resume and cover letter
* Your GitHub repositories - evidence of what you've done
* Personal website and/or blog, e.g., www.dixonaws.com
  * You can easily develop a personal website with tools like [hugo](http://www.gohugo.io) or [docusaurus](http://www.docusaurus.io) and host in AWS or GitHub
* Your YouTube videos - a starter is your video homework from Silver Lining
* Your LinkedIn profile
* Your personal network
